HackerEarth Machine Learning challenge : Adopt a buddy

1. Performed EDA , and found that "condition" column had some NULL values. On more
   analysis I found that all the condition column with NULL values had same
   breed category 2.0.

		----->>> "breed_category" PREDICTION <<<---------
1.  For Breed Prediction I assumed that "breed_category" is independent from 
    "pet_category".
2.  Tools I used are :
	1. Simple Imputer - to fill NULL values (if any).
	2. OneHotEncoder  - to convert non-numeric columns to numeric columns.
3.  Used RandomForestClassifier to classify the breeds.
4.  Performed GridSearchCV with different values to improve the model accuracy.

Applied Similar Steps to predict "pet_category".
